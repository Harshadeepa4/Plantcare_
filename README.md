# AI Crop Disease Detection Platform - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for an AI-powered crop disease detection platform. The platform allows users to interact with the AI model to detect diseases in crops through a user-friendly interface. The frontend is built using **Vite**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lucid React**.




## Features

- **Real-time Crop Disease Detection**: Upload crop images and receive predictions about potential diseases.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and responsive interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Fast Development and Build Process**: The project uses Vite for a faster development and build experience.
- **AI Integration**: Interact with an AI model to detect diseases in crops and provide insights into how to manage them.
- **Lucid React for Enhanced UI Components**: Use of Lucid React to create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool for fast development and bundling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and customizable user interfaces.
- **Lucid React**: A React component library used to create clean and visually attractive user interfaces.
- **AI Model Integration**: The frontend interacts with a backend AI model (e.g., TensorFlow, Flask, or Node.js) to provide real-time crop disease predictions.
